The Latex_Source_Files folder contains the latex source code for the manuscript and supplemental files, as well as all the images. The Manuscript file is the final version of the PDF file. It ensures that the author list, affiliations, and corresponding author information are correct, where the author's information has been listed on the first page and the author's introduction has been placed on the last page of the manuscript (Page 13). The Supplement file is also the final version of the PDF file.
